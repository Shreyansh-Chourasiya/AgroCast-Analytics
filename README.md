# AgroCast-Analytics

◦ Single-handedly designed and developed Web Application of Agrocast Analytics

◦ When farmers select their farm area on the application, all the details will be stored in mySQL database
and Agrocast’s machine learning algorithm will display valuable data for the farm

◦ Integrated Mapbox API to include map features in the web application

◦ Worked with advanced JavaScript and PHP libraries such as TURF, jQuery, Axios, and cURL
